I am Chenhan Wang, a final-year Master’s student in Computer Science and Technology at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). My research focuses on **distributed systems**, particularly addressing efficiency and reliability challenges in ML systems and storage systems. I am broadly interested in systems research.

I am currently advised by Prof. [Cheng Li](https://mr-cheng-li.github.io/) at USTC, Prof. [Kang Chen](https://madsys.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/author/kang-chen/) at Tsinghua University, and interning at ByteDance Seed. Previously, I worked with Dr. [Yiting Xia](https://sites.google.com/view/yitingxia/home) at MPI-INF.

I am actively seeking **Ph.D. opportunities for Fall 2026** in system research. Please feel free to contact me.
